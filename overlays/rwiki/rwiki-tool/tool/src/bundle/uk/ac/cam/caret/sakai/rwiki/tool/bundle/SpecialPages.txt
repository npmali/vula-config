All special pages can be customized by editing them in the same way as any other wiki page.

h2 Default template
The [default_template] page is used as the template for new pages. You can customize this page (for example to include a navigation structure), or remove its contents so that new pages are created empty.

h2 Help Page
The [Help] page provides detailed help.

h2 Index
The [Index] page lists all pages in this wiki. You can also include an index on any wiki page by using the \{index\} macro.

h2 Recent Changes
The [Recent Changes] page lists recent changes to all pages in this wiki. You can also include a recent changes list on any wiki page by using the \{recent-changes\} macro.

h2 Edit Right
The [edit_right] page is displayed in a column to the right of the editor window when you are editing a page. This page provides useful information about wiki markup that you may need while editing.

h2 View Right
The [view_right] page is displayed in a column to the right of the current page when viewing a page. This page does not exist by default, but if created can be used to provide a navigation structure or other helpful information for wiki readers (such as an index or list of recent changes).
