<h2>SMS Messages: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>
<p>The SMS Messages tool allows you to send SMS messages to users in a site. You can select who should receive
 the message by role, group, name or by pasting a list of cellphone numbers. You can also schedule a message
 to be sent out at a later date and time.</p>
<h3>Setting up SMS Messages in a site</h3>
<p>To send SMS messages from Vula, first purchase Vula SMS credits through a SAP Journal 
Transfer. Download and complete the 
<a href="https://vula.uct.ac.za/web/public/docs/sms/Vula-SMS-Journal.docx">SMS Order Journal Form</a>
(<a href="https://vula.uct.ac.za/web/public/docs/sms/Vula-SMS-Journal.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>). A 
<a href="https://vula.uct.ac.za/web/public/docs/sms/Vula-SMS-Journal-SAMPLE.docx">sample form</a> 
(<a href="https://vula.uct.ac.za/web/public/docs/sms/Vula-SMS-Journal-SAMPLE.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)
shows a completed example.</p> 
<p>Once completed send the form to: Vula Help Desk, RM 7.56, Centre for Innovation in Learning and Teaching (CILT), PD Hahn Building, Upper Campus. Once the order form reaches CILT, the Vula team will add the SMS Messages tool to the designated site and allocate the requested number of SMS credits to the site.</p>
<p>For any queries about the ordering or accounting process, contact the Vula team at
<a href="mailto:help@vula.uct.ac.za?Subject=Vula%20SMS">help@vula.uct.ac.za</a>.</p>
<h3>Opting out from receiving SMS messages</h3>
<p>If you do not wish to receive SMS messages from Vula sites, go to 
<strong>Home / Profile / Edit My Profile</strong> and set the option 
<i>Allow Vula users to send SMS messages to my cellphone</i> to <strong>No</strong>.</p>
<h3>Privacy issues and profile settings</h3>
<p>Individual cellphone numbers remain private. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a user of the SMS Messages tool, you will be able to select recipients by role, group or name,
 but you will not be able to see the cellphone numbers of those recipients, either when sending the message 
 or when viewing the delivery report.</li>
 <li>As a Vula user, your cellphone number is hidden by default, and will not be disclosed to any other users, 
 unless you explicitly make your cellphone number visible by going to  
<strong>Home / Profile / Edit My Profile</strong> and set the option <i>Hide my cell phone number</i> to No.</li>
 </ul>
<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>At present, it is only possible to send SMS messages to <b>South African numbers</b>.
Support for sending messages to international recipients will be added at a future date.</li>
<li>Cellphone numbers for some users in a site may be missing or out-of-date, or users may have opted
 out of receiving SMS messages. An SMS message therefore may not reach all of the targeted users.</li>
</ul>
